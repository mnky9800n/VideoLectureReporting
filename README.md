# VideoLectureReporting

This module is built to provide generic reporting capabilities for 
video viewing behavior on the Coursera Course Management Platform.
VideoLectureReporting has two functions:

1) It prepares data from Coursera for reporting

2) It generates a report of the data for dissemination

More features may be added later to process and visualize clickstream
data. This module is primarily used for the Georgia Tech Introductory
Physics MOOC but it may be used for other Coursera courses.
