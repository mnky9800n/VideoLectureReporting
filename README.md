# VideoLectureReporting

This module is built to provide generic reporting capabilities for 
video viewing behavior on the Coursera Course Management Platform.
VideoLectureReporting has two functions:

1) It prepares data from Coursera for reporting

2) It generates a report of the data for dissemination

More features may be added later to process and visualize clickstream
data.
